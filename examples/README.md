# There are the following files contain the ES examples:

## Example 1: LBFO dataset demo
![Implementation of Updated Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Atom Finding using Early stopping](https://github.com/Pragalbhv/atomai/blob/master/examples/notebooks/EarlyStopping_LBFO_pv.ipynb)

## Example 2: HRTEM dataset (Au/CdSe/Combined) demo
![Implementation of Updated DCNN equipped with Early stopping and automatic-binary-thresholding for Nano-particle Segmentation](https://github.com/Pragalbhv/atomai/blob/master/examples/notebooks/EarlyStopping_HRTEM_pv.ipynb)

### The following configurations were used for training
The parameters like training cycles, patience, and the number of augmented images created are modified so as to run in a Google colab notebook without any premium resources. 
The training cycles were set to 5000 and patience to 500, and the number of images produced was ~ 2500.

One only needs to run the Colab notebooks as is. However, if one wants to test it on a personal machine, they can download the necessary datafiles ![here.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EstVJ5E26k3Juii_K82b88gYmBYrE-4J)
